  abstract={The ATLAS experiment is one of the experiments at the Large Hadron
  Collider, constructed to study elementary particle interactions in collisions of
  high-energy proton beams. The individual detector components as well as the
  common experimental infrastructure are supervised by the Detector Control System
  (DCS). The DCS enables equipment supervision using operator commands, reads,
  processes and archives the operational parameters of the detector, allows for
  error recognition and handling, manages the communication with external control
  systems, and provides a synchronization mechanism with the physics data
  acquisition system. Given the enormous size and complexity of ATLAS, special
  emphasis was put on the use of standardized hardware and software components
  enabling efficient development and long-term maintainability of the DCS over the
  lifetime of the experiment. Currently, the DCS is being used successfully during
  the experiment commissioning phase.},
